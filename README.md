## GPT-4 Website
A nice way to interact with GPT-4 via the api. Right now the model is set to `gpt-4o`.

### Setup
Clone/Download the repo and run the `main.py` file. Make sure you have your openai api key set. From there connect to the url shown. 

### Usage
Simply go onto the website and use the prompt input field to enter your prompt. **The key is set to `gpt4` right now** but this can be changed in the `main.py` file. To reset chat history, enter `reset` in the key input.

To change the model, simply swap out the model name on line 39 of `main.py`
